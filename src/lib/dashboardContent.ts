// ADDING A NEW YEAR (e.g. 2027)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// There is no database here on purpose — this file *is* the dashboard's data.
// To make 2027 (or any other year) appear in the dashboard's year dropdown,
// just add a booking with `year: 2027` to any resort below:
//
//   { id: "KL364001", status: "Paid",
//     dateRange: "Mar 14, 2027 - Mar 21, 2027",
//     year: 2027, payoutCents: 310000 }
//
// The dropdown, the total payout figure, the "All Listings (N)" counter and
// the card grid all derive from these objects via getAvailableYears() /
// getBookingsForYear() at the bottom of this file. No component changes, no
// route changes, no migration — save the file and 2027 is there, selected by
// default because the list is sorted newest-first.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Koala's actual resort data (from the resort details he provided).
//
// Scope was for 3-4 resorts on this page. The layout (grid, "All Listings (N)"
// counter, total payout) scales cleanly to more without any code changes. To
// add the next resort, copy one of the objects below, swap in its real Ref ID
// / dates / year / payout, and point `image` at a photo dropped into
// public/images/ (rsort-img3.webp is already sitting in that folder, unused,
// ready for the next resort once its details come in).
